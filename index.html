        <h2>Welcome to my Coding Resource Hub!</h2>
        <p> Hello! As a computer science student, I've found that it is sometimes difficult to manage my time correctly during the day. Whether it be lack of energy and not getting enough work done during the day, to getting stumped on an error in your program that you just can't quite fix! I've created a resource hub with everything that helps me get through my day as a coder. Below, you'll find everything from coffee recipes to helpful cheatsheets. I hope you can make as much use of it as I do!</p><br><br><br>
